 PC_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We believe it necessary to enlighten lesser cultures such as yourselves, but the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] savages are so primitive it's hard to tell whether it's even possible with your species..."
 PC_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Sometimes we read about the squalid conditions of your people, and wonder how anyone could live in such a state of nature."
 PC_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "It's undeniable that you are barbarians that need to be taught proper etiquette. Meeting you is always a painful experience."
 PC_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Look at the pathetic, primitive [From.GetSpeciesName]. Some day we will civilize you, hard as it might be."
 PC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "It seems that your people are primitive. Perhaps you would like to learn more about our superior culture?"
 PC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "It is difficult for us to understand your primitive customs, but we try for the sake of diplomacy."
 PC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We have your best interests in mind. Some day, we shall teach you the proper ways of civilization, somehow. It is the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj]'s burden."
 PC_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "What can we expect from filthy little heathens? You're savages! Savages!"
 PC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Despite hailing from a primitive, undeveloped culture, we feel that [From.GetSpeciesName] can be considered noble savages."
 PC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Endure, good friends! Someday you will be as civilized as us."
 PC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Some heathen savages refuse to accept the superiority of our culture, and refuse to civilize themselves. We are glad you are not one of those."
 PC_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Savages! Savages! Dirty shrieking devils! Barely even sentient!"
 PC_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We have tried our hardest to teach the [From.GetSpeciesName] and raise them to an acceptable level of civilization. It seems that we must resort to force now."
 PC_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Savages! Savages! Now we sound the drums of war!"
 # Vassal greetings

 # Savage Raiders
 SR_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName] seem... vulnerable. Better be careful, or else we might just... pillage you..."
 SR_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "As much as we like pillaging our foes, it seems that the uncultured and pathetic [From.GetSpeciesName] are devoid of worthwhile objects to plunder."
 SR_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName] have grown complacent and lazy. Would be a shame of anyone tried attacking you, seizing all of your riches..."
 SR_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We're just playing nice with you for now. Prepare now, pathetic [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]! We'll be raiding and pillaging you eventually."
 SR_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Your people seem to have some riches we might desire eventually..."
 SR_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Who needs diplomacy when we could just pillage you? Don't worry, we'll start raiding you eventually, but for now we've decided to leave you be."
 SR_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are not one for false pleasantries such as this, as we prefer pillaging our enemies. Still, we'll listen, for now."
 SR_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetName] are arrogant and decadent. Soon, we'll be nipping away at your strength."
 SR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Your people are wise and strong. It would be unwise for us to provoke such a mighty nation with our usual raids. Perhaps you have an enemy we can pillage?"
 SR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "We consider the [From.GetSpeciesName] to be a worthy and honorable adversary. As such, we shall not pillage your lands unless necessary."
 SR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Though it is in our nature to raid and pillage, we recognize it when we see a great nation such as the [From.GetSpeciesName], and we promise not to offend you in any way."
 SR_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Bah! Back to pillaging! Back to raiding! Begone before we kill you all!"
 SR_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Beware, [From.GetRulerName]! The greatest joy for a [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] warrior is to defeat his enemies, to drive them before him, to take from them all they possess, to see those they love in tears, and to hold their wives and daughters in his arms."
 SR_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We will pillage you so thoroughly your people shall languish in poverty and starvation until the end of time!"
 # Vassal greetings

 # Defenders of the Faith
 DOTF_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Heathen! The heavens shall smite you for your blasphemous ways!"
 DOTF_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "You are a threat to true believers across the galaxy. You are in league with the demons and devils, no doubt. A warning - our holy warriors are trained to fight against your type."
 DOTF_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "How can we ever reason with heretics such as the [From.GetSpeciesName]? Someday, we will fight a holy war against you, no doubt."
 DOTF_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "See the might of our faith! Cower before our holy knights, heathen!"
 DOTF_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Be you heaven-fearing friend, or demon-following foe? This is something our clergy will have to look into."
 DOTF_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Maybe we will have to wage a holy war against you one day. Maybe not. Only time will tell..."
 DOTF_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are more than willing to live in peace, but if you so as much threaten the sanctity of our faith, our holy knights shall show you no mercy."
 DOTF_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Do not be prideful, heathens. Our holy knights are protected by the heavens, your heretical warriors are nothing."
 DOTF_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! Our good friends! What heathens have you smote as of late?"
 DOTF_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Perhaps we will be able to rid the universe of the demons and devils one day."
 DOTF_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Heresy is a terrible thing. We are glad that you are not blasphemers. Otherwise our holy knights would've had to take care of you."
 DOTF_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "HEAVEN WILLS IT! DEATH TO THE HEATHENS!"
 DOTF_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Coward. That's all you are. Our holy knights are protected by faith in this holy war. Heaven wills it!"
 DOTF_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "What hope have you against the truth, false believer? Our armies shall prevail in this holy war."
 # Vassal greetings
 DOTF_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Yes, noble master? Shall we wage holy war against our enemies today?"

 CH_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName] are what exactly what's wrong with the system... you... you are a repressive people.... Something's wrong with your energy flow."
 CH_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Sometimes, I think that [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] just needs to relax... go with the flow... but it's like the [From.GetSpeciesName] can't."
 CH_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Why can't you just go with the flow? Accept the power? Just listen... and relax..."
 CH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Hey there, pal. Before we start negotiating, just take some deep breaths. In, and out. In, and out. Feel one with the universe."
 CH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Just because we're easygoing and prefer to go with the flow, doesn't mean we can't fight for ourselves... it makes us even more dangerous!"
 CH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Live in the present! Relax and be free! Then maybe we can have a enlightening discussion..."
 CH_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "[From.GetName] should be careful. The universe is infinite and beautiful and bountiful, your might is nothing compared to its wonders."
 CH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "What a great day this is! The people of [Root.GetName] think that the [From.GetSpeciesName] are totally cool and radical."
 CH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Together, we will both admire the beauty of our universe... be one with the universe... be the universe.... What was I saying?"
 CH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. Seeing the [From.GetSpeciesName] always makes me feel a sense of inner peace."
 CH_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Looks like someone needs to be taught a lesson on shown some inner peace..."
 CH_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "What's wrong with the [From.GetSpeciesName]? You all are so... uncool. That's why we have to fight you."
 CH_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We fight against the system, we fight against you, vile authoritarian oppressors! Free the [From.GetSpeciesName]!"

 # Open-Minded Worshippers
 OMW_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Our scholars constantly try to find something good about the beliefs of the [From.GetSpeciesName], but always come up short."
 OMW_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Although we like to engage in an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding, it is difficult with those such as yourselves."
 OMW_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "We fear that the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] are growing up in an environment that is not conducive to their spiritual and personal development."
 OMW_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Though your culture is undeniably undeveloped and unsophisticated, we still believe it is important for us to be narrow-minded. It's not your fault your people are so... primitive."
 OMW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Well met. We seek to better understand the beliefs of others. In doing so, we can better understand ourselves."
 OMW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We hope that the leaders of [From.GetName] are as willing to engage in fruitful dialogue about the differences and similarities between our cultures and belief systems."
 OMW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "It is important that we understand each other spiritually, even if we don't believe the same things."
 OMW_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We know that you look down on us, but please try to be open-minded, and understanding towards those who have different points of view."
 OMW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! Our friends! It is always our pleasure to have friendly, insightful debates with you about the nature of the cosmos."
 OMW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Even if a [Root.GetSpeciesName] and a [From.GetSpeciesName] don't see eye to eye on some things, our similarities and mutual understanding are always greater than our differences and disagreements."
 OMW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Engaging with religious debate with you is always a great honor. Though we may disagree on some key issues, we believe that the scholars of [From.GetName] merely have a different perspective, never a misguided or wrong one."
 OMW_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Sometimes, we must fight. It is sad, as your culture and beliefs have its beauty, but your leaders are a disagreeable lot."
 OMW_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "How our two peoples suffer! This is why we dislike war. Why can we not discuss our differences in an atmosphere of peace and understanding? But sometimes it is necessary to raise arms and wage war."
 OMW_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We would much rather discuss our differences by means of a pleasant, intellectual conversation, but war works fine for us too."
 # Vassal greetings
 OMW_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetName] have such a beautiful and noble way of thinking. Even if we don't always agree with it, we are proud to be loyal followers of the [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 # Declaration of War
 OMW_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! We hate conflict, we really do. But sometimes we have no choice."
 
 # Studious Builders
 SB_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We are considering erecting a great monument to the stupidity and savagery of the [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 SB_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "It is difficult for our people to live in peace when they know that inelegant, unsophisticated fools such as the [From.GetSpeciesName] exist."
 SB_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "The [From.GetName] is a disgrace to the galaxy. We intend to build a great museum dedicated solely to explaining your failures and flaws."
 SB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Maybe we should just destroy the [From.GetName] and use your ashes as building material. Or food. Either works."
 SB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We the [Root.GetName] have little interest in your affairs, so long as you do not interfere in ours. Still, we are more than willing to negotiate treaties favorable to both parties."
 SB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We did not expect you. Be forewarned, we are not interested in getting involved in any conflict you are part of, either as an ally or a foe."
 SB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Perhaps someday we shall send our best engineers and artisans to travel to your lands and study the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] methods of construction and how you manage your infrastructure."
 SB_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We plead you to practice prudence. We have put a lot of work into building our society, and it would be a waste if you did anything to it!"
 SB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Hail! Perhaps someday we should construct a glorious monument to the friendship between our two peoples that utilizes the best engineering and architectural techniques and styles from both."
 SB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "It is an honor to speak with you. We prefer to focus on building up our own society, but we see no reason to mingle with loyal and trusted friends such as the [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 SB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "This is a wonderful opportunity for our engineers, scholars, and artisans to engage in dialogue and exchange ideas."
 SB_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Your society is not even worth destroying, but we will stamp you out like the pathetic [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] you are!"
 SB_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "After this war is over we shall erect a great monument celebrating our victory over the [From.GetName]!"
 SB_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "This war is costly but we must fight, it seems. Once we are done fighting, our leaders will construct a tall and mighty monument celebrating our victory over you, pathetic [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]."
 # Vassal greetings
 SB_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "We are glad to see you again. Perhaps you should patronize the construction of a great memorial celebrating our service and devotion to the [From.GetName]."
 # Declaration of War
 SB_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Although our resources are usually devoted to building our society, celebrating our culture, and developing our infrastructure, we can easily use them to build a mighty war machine which will topple you as well!"
 
 # Hedonistic Visionaries (aka Bioshock references)
 HV_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "In the end what separates a [Root.GetSpeciesName] from a [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]? Money? Power? No, a [Root.GetSpeciesName] chooses, and a [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] obeys!"
 HV_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "What is the difference between a [Root.GetSpeciesName] and a [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]? A [Root.GetSpeciesName] builds. A [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] asks 'Where is my share?' A [Root.GetSpeciesName] creates. A [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] says, 'What will the neighbors think?' A [Root.GetSpeciesName] invents. A [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] says, 'Watch out, or you might tread on the toes of heaven... '"
 HV_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Would you kindly just leave the [Root.GetName] alone?"
 HV_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Would you kindly just grovel before us, pathetic slave?"
 HV_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us. I am interested in knowing what sort of choices the [From.GetName] will make in the future."
 HV_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "I am a representative of [Root.GetName], and I'm here to ask the [From.GetName] a question. Is a [Root.GetSpeciesName] not entitled to the sweat of their brow?"
 HV_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "What is the greatest lie every created? What is the most vicious obscenity ever perpetrated on the [From.GetName]? Slavery? Genocide? Dictatorship? No. It's the tool with which all [From.GetSpeciesAdj] wickedness is built: altruism."
 HV_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Though you have much power, [From.GetSpeciesName], you are still slaves. A [Root.GetSpeciesName] is free, for he chooses. A [From.GetSpeciesName] must obey."
 HV_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "It was your strength of will that brought you here, and with that strength we shall build a better and brighter future for the galaxy."
 HV_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "A [Root.GetSpeciesName] chooses. A [From.GetSpeciesName] also chooses. Our two peoples are free. It is the parasites elsewhere in the galaxy that obey, mere slaves."
 HV_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "We consider the [Root.GetSpeciesName] to be great, just like us. Let the small not constrain the great! Let us be free to choose! We, of course, have chosen friendship with you."
 HV_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "A [Root.GetSpeciesName] chooses, and a [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] obeys! And we choose to fight this war until the bitter end!"
 HV_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "You can kill us all, but you will never have the [Root.GetSpeciesName]. Though our physical defences may fall, you'll never defeat [Root.GetName]. Our strength is not in steel and fire, but in intellect and will. That is what you [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] will never understand."
 HV_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "The [Root.GetName] came to this galaxy to build the impossible. The [From.GetName] came to rob what you could never build. We will defend ourselves, for we are free, and you are slaves!"
 # Vassal greetings
 HV_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Even in a book of lies sometimes you find truth. There is indeed a season for all things and in the present circumstances the [Root.GetName] knows it cannot raise their arms against the [From.GetName]. Be forewarned, though, we are free at heart, and not slaves. We do not obey, but merely choose to follow you."

 # Generous Philanthropists
 GP_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "You are an affront to peace-loving nations across the galaxy. You do not deserve our help, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]."
 GP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetName] is dedicated to helping everyone prosper, but we do not think you are worthy of it. Reform your politics and your culture, and then we might reconsider."
 GP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Coming to us to beg for our aid? We don't give any aid to inhumane, barbaric peoples like the [From.GetSpeciesName] who mistreat their own citizens."
 GP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We've considered helping the impoverished, pathetic kind, but that would be a waste of resources that could be better spent helping other undeveloped nations that actually need it."
 GP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Well met. We are more than happy to share our abundance with you, so long as you do the same."
 GP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We are only here to help the rest of the galaxy. If you have similar interests, it is best you do not interfere."
 GP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We welcome peace with your great nation. I pray that no future misunderstanding will come between our two peoples."
 GP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Your arrogance knows no bound, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. Remember, just because you are powerful, doesn't mean you are right. We are all part of the galactic community, and you best understand that before it's too late."
 GP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! Our good friends! Let us discuss how we can make the galaxy a better place. Surely there are many underdeveloped species that need our help."
 GP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "We have worked hard to make this galaxy a better place to live in. It is important we safeguard every species' basic dignity and inalienable rights."
 GP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Good, you have come just in time! This is a good opportunity as any other to talk about ways we can continue developing the galaxy for the betterment of all."

 # Vassal greetings

 GP_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! The [From.GetName] has been known for its gross violations of intergalactic law. You shall be punished for your transgressions. We do not hate the citizens of the [From.GetName], for we sympathize with their suffering under the brutal regime of [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName]."
 
 # Adventure Seekers (aka sort of millennials)
 AS_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The galaxy is full of wonders waiting to be seen, with so many interesting worlds... except for [From.GetHomeWorldName], which is apparently a hive of scum and villainy."
 AS_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName] are a useless pile of [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] manure. It's time you showed us some respect, you know? It's hard to believe anyone would want to live in a [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]-infested garbage landfill like [From.GetHomeWorldName]."
 AS_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Hurry up. We have more interesting worlds to explore, more interesting cuisines to sample, more interesting cultures to discover than yours."
 AS_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Most citizens of the [Root.GetName] believe that the [From.GetName] is full of ignorance and oppression. Our government encourages tourists to visit [From.GetHomeWorldName] so they can realize how good they have it and to not take their privilege for granted."
 AS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We [Root.GetSpeciesName] are always willing to go on new adventures. Perhaps we can start be asking where we can get some authentic [From.GetSpeciesAdj] food? Culinary adventures are always a good way to begin a new adventure."
 AS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "So little time, so much to explore. There are a growing number of [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] tourists who would be interested in seeing the wonders of [From.GetHomeWorldName]"
 AS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are pioneers first and foremost, who seek to find the freshest, most authentic experiences possible. We hope that the ancient culture of the [From.GetName] can satisfy our wnaderlust."
 AS_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Check your privilege, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]."
 AS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Our citizens started liking the culture and ways of the [From.GetName] before it was mainstream. We are the only ones who have an authentic respect for your beautiful, exotic culture."
 AS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Everywhere I go, I hear [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] citizens talking about how amazing [From.GetSpeciesAdj] culture must be. It seems so exotic, and yet so genuine, to them."
 AS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesAdj] foodies really love the cuisine from the [From.GetName]. It's like getting to know an entire culture just from eating a few dishes!"
 AS_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "We usually prefer to explore the wonders of different cultures, but your culture is so depraved and full of oppression it's better we destroy it with fire."
 AS_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Check your damn privilege, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. We fight the [From.GetName] and its oppressive ways!"
 AS_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We're trying to engage in 'dialogue' when we should be killing each other in the battlefield. This is what they call irony."

 SI_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Pray tell what you want from us. We are not eager to engage with xenos."
 SI_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Right then... quickly explain your intentions. We will probably not agree to your inane requests, but who knows."
 SI_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Admittedly the threat that the [From.GetName] poses to our innocent civilians is high. We have instructed them to keep calm and carry on, and we will continue to watch you warily. We do not want any trouble."
 SI_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We always have a smashing good time when [From.GetSpeciesAdj] ambassadors come to visit. Let us drink some herbal concoctions before we engage in negotiations."

 SI_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Even if we lose, we will brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves, that if the [Root.GetName] lasts for a thousand years, they will still say, 'This was their finest hour.' We will prevail against your tyranny in this war."
 SI_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "I say, nice brawl we are having, aren't we, old chap? I do enjoy these little exchange of pleasantries in between battle, even though we must slay you in the end."
 # Vassal greetings

 IM_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "We need to learn about other, powerful states so that we can improve our situation. However, we find there is little to learn from the uncultured [From.GetSpeciesName]. Can the [From.GetName] even consider itself a proper civilization?"

 # Efficient Bureaucrats
 EB_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Thank you for contacting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our representatives are currently all busy negotiating with more civilized xenos unlike the barbarian [From.GetSpeciesName]. Currently, it will take... two hundred years for the next representative to be available. Thank you for waiting. If you wish to hear this message again, please press 4."
 EB_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "We prefer not to engage in negotiations with the pathetic parasites from [From.GetName]. According to the latest guidelines published by Administrative Guidelines Agency in concurrence with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the [From.GetName] is not to be trusted, and I can see why."
 EB_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Why am I meeting with you? This must be some sort of clerical error. Senior [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] bureaucrats have told me we have no interest in the savages that call themselves the [From.GetName]. Very well, you may speak, but I will have to file a complaint with the Department of Scheduling and Meetings after this."
 EB_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "I am sorry, but I will need to put you on hold. We have more important matters to attend to at the moment. I am extremely overworked and dealing with the [From.GetName] is not a high priority for us at the moment."
 EB_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "Please sign forms P245, X9-11, and R9-42-5NX. No offense, but we have little trust in your government's institutions, so we need to make sure everything is in order before we can begin negotiations."
 EB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Now serving number... wait, who are you again? Oh, you are one of those undeveloped [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]s from the [From.GetName]. This was not supposed to be on my schedule, you were supposed to be with a lesser representative who meets with inferior primitives such as yourself. Can someone get my secretary?"
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Welcome to the [Root.GetName]. Before we begin negotiations, please complete these forms here. Yes, specifically form AT6X-231, 32P9, TT4-01, 6GJKF-F, and CU11-7. There are several other forms you need to do as well, but you must see the Domestic Security Commission to get them. Oh, also, we only accept black ink."
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Please wait a moment, I must file forms BX-22-A and KSD-34 for the Diplomatic Records Agency before we can begin negotiations. This will only take a few minutes, I assure you. Now... where did I put my pen.... I hope I didn't lose it, otherwise I would have to file a report to the DRA for that."
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "There seems to be a mistake here. Why did you file form AT6X-224? You were supposed to file form AT6X-231. We cannot proceed with negotiations until you finish the correct form. Sorry, this is just administrative protocol. Your twenty other forms have been filed correctly at least. Here, you can borrow my pen."
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "Now serving number 1958374. Or I think that's your number. Thank you for waiting. Who are you and how may we help you?"
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "I just need you to sign here, and here, and here. If you want to know, these are forms NYE-7, FU88-20, and ZZXO, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs needs to have these sent to the Policy and Planning Agency before we are allowed to continue."
 EB_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "The Bureau of Analysis and Statistics has determined the [From.GetName] is of greater strength than the [Root.GetName]. I must report to the Xeno Policy Agency soon so we can determine how to best proceed with such a violent, animalistic aggressor."
 EB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "I unfortunately have a schedule conflict, but meeting with our friends from the [From.GetName] is much more important than whatever bureaucratic business I might have had. After all, we will happily cut through any red tape if it allows for us to continue our beneficial relationship with you."
 EB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Thank you for contacting the [Root.GetName]'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Our representatives are currently all busy negotiating with more barbaric xenos unlike the civilized [From.GetSpeciesName]. However, you are very important to us, so we will try to send someone over as soon as we can, even if it means cutting red tape. If you wish to hear this message again, please press 8."
 EB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "We are considering creating a sub-agency within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the Bureau of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] Affairs, so that we can continue building an even closer relationship with the [From.GetName]. Unfortunately it will take a lot of time and paperwork...."
 EB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Don't worry, friend. I've already filled out all the forms for you (forms PX-22, GURG-8, YAPW, 5823-SAF, and 15-WRI as you can see here). I don't want to waste your valuable time."

 EB_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] Office of Logistics is currently filing out paperwork to develop newer and better weapons that can be used against you, groveling [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. Hopefully, the Ministry of Defense will approve our paperwork!"
 EB_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Why are you here? Security protocols XTV-22 and G8-4DTJ should have made it so you could not come here. Begone! We are at war, and you are wasting time I could spend filing out important bureaucratic documents!"
 EB_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "Great. Now that you've come here I must file out forms 93-SFD, FIE-134-34N, and IAF-2 to the Ministry of Suspicious Foreign Contacts and the Xeno Policy Agency. That's just the protocol when we're at war.. Wait a moment, this won't take long."
 EB_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "Please sign these forms here. Don't worry, this is form XUD-4. You were thinking of XUD-1. XUD-1 is the one you need to sign to surrender to us, XUD-4 is merely the one you need to sign if you want to negotiate with us."

 GF_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Remember, [From.GetSpeciesName], we can easily be friends just as we can easily be enemies. We are fine with having another good neighbor around, but we are not reluctant to fight and defend ourselves if necessary. Keep that in mind."
 GF_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Just as a warning - we will not be pushed around by aggressors such as the [From.GetName]. Sure, you may be stronger than us, but strength is not equivalent to victory and success"

 CN_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Our warriors look across your borders and see a weak and decadent state ripe for the picking. Surely your precious artwork and goods will sell for a very high price on [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] markets, even if your citizens are otherwise worthless."
 CN_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "We are always open to adopting the ideas of other cultures, but we find that [From.GetSpeciesAdj] society has little to offer, as it is worthless and full of vice and inefficiency."
 CN_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "The circle is now complete. When we first met you, we were but the learners. Now WE are the masters."
 CN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Welcome. Though we are a warlike people at heart, we always are willing to learn about the finer things in life from the [From.GetName]. Do not, however, mistake our willingness to adopt your customs as weakness on our part."
 CN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesName] is full of wanderlust. We search among the galaxy for new homes and new resources. we search the battlefield for glory and honor, and we search our intellects for culture, government, and art."
 CN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Remember that we are not to be trifled with. As much as we enjoy the finer things in life, we will quickly don our armor and ready our weapons if the situation calls for it."
 CN_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Oh look at you, so proud and arrogant. We are warriors and explorers as much as we are scholars and artists. What makes a [Root.GetSpeciesName] a [Root.GetSpeciesName] is the bravery!"

 CN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] armies are the equal of [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] armies. Your learning is equal to ours. The sophistry and depth of your art is also equal to ours. We are almost like brothers and sisters in arms."
 CN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "The [Root.GetName] sends its warm regards to [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName]. We are admittedly an uncouth race from time to time, but we mean well and hope our days of friendship will continue."
 CN_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "The average [Root.GetSpeciesName] is just as eager to study science or recite poetry as he is to do battle against the [From.GetSpeciesName]!"

 ST_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Go away! We wouldn't want to sell any of our slaves to you. Even that would be too much for them."
 ST_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Have you come here to offer yourselves as our slaves? The offer's tempting, but we wouldn't take it. You're not fit to be slaves, selling you would result in no financial gain whatsoever."
 ST_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We are so very tempted to just seize your territories and enslave your entire populace, but we have yet to calculate the profits from that."
 ST_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Have you come to do business with the [Root.GetName]? We specialize in the slave trade but are also willing to trade in other commodities such as foodstuffs, raw materials, and processed goods."
 ST_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "You better not be one of those annoying idealists coming to tell us about how terrible we are for our slave trade. They just don't understand that life in this galaxy doesn't work according to their ideals."
 ST_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are more than happy to work together with you to make a profit. Buying slaves now might prove to be a worthwhile investment for the [From.GetName] in the future."
 ST_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "What do you want? Just leave us be. We know you could easily destroy our entire economy, but we see that you are restrianing for now. What, are you going to try to 'free' our slaves? Realize that it won't do anything - there are plenty of more worthwhile lands you can conquer, other slaves to free."
 ST_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Friend, it's a delight to see you! I must give you a gift. Would you like a highly-valued pleasure slave, skilled in many forms of entertainment? Or a warrior slave, to defend you forever and ever more? If you want something else perhaps I can give you gourmet [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] pastries or other kinds of luxuries..."
 ST_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "If there are ever any [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves in the [Root.GetName], we try our best to ensure that they are given to kind and wise masters. We always want to make sure our [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends are treated well, even if they are slaves!"

 ST_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "You know we do not enjoy waging war, given the risks it poses, but sometimes we have to do what we have to do. At the least, this war gives us new opportunities to acquire some [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves."
 ST_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "I hope that any [Root.GetSpeciesName] master that happens to own a [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slave treats them horribly! We will continue to fight until every last [From.GetSpeciesName] is enslaved and sold to the highest bidder!"

 # Sublime Porte
 SP_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The trinkets the [From.GetName] sell are not even worth one coin. Why do you come here to bother us?"
 SP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Relations between our two states is tense and full of hostility. We do not say this to be tactless, we merely state the truth. We see little will come of negotiations."
 SP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "A wise [Root.GetSpeciesName] knows when it is best to be silent. Unfortunately, the [From.GetSpeciesName] is not wise, and seeks instead to trouble us with the incessant blabber of fools."
 SP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetName] is like a prey in a galaxy full of predators. Be careful, now."
 SP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "You are welcome to the [Root.GetName]. We are used to having many visitors from afar. Merchants, pilgrims, travelers, soldiers, scholars. We welcome all, so long as they do not disrupt our peace."
 SP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetName] is made up of many different cultures who all coexist. There are always tensions, but we do our best to ensure everyone lives in harmony. It is best that you are aware of this."
 SP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "There are always new opportunities to trade, and some [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] merchants have expressed interest in the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] market. Perhaps the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName] shall negotiate a treaty acceptable to us both. An exchange of goods, as well as ideas and cultures, would be encouraging."
 SP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetName] is like a rose with thorns. Dangerous, lethal even, but the [Root.GetSpeciesName] cannot deny it has a certain beauty and allure. We only hope you are more the latter than the former."
 SP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Many think of wealth and power as the greatest of achievements, but in this galaxy good health is peerless. The [Root.GetName] sends nothing but well wishes to the [From.GetName], that the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] state may forever be strong and healthy until the end of days!"
 SP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Welcome, welcome! Let us feast and enjoy ourselves first, before we start negotiations. Exotic fruits? Gourmet delicacies? The sweetest of desserts? Anything for the most esteemed and venerable representatives of the [From.GetName]."
 SP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Ah, you know, friend, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] products sell for high prices in our bazaars. It seems that many in the [Root.GetName] have taken a liking to the goods your people produce."
 SP_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Death is so fleeting, but glory is forever. The deeds of [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] warriors as they defeat their [From.GetSpeciesAdj] foes shall be remembered by generations to come!"
 SP_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We grant you the courtesy of meeting us during war. We expect that you come here for good reason, ergo. Perhaps you are here to surrender?"

 # Enterprising Corsairs
 EC_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We now cast covetous eyes on the vulnerable citizens of the [From.GetName], for they would make good slaves.... Careful now, good friend, we might just be tempted to take them and sell them to the highest bidder."
 EC_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "It is clear that the [From.GetSpeciesName] is only good for two things: either to toil for us as physical laborers, or serve us as pleasure slaves. Sometimes we wonder why we even let you have your independence. Perhaps we shall rectify that problem someday, by conquering and enslaving every last [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 EC_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Well? What is it? We're not selling any of our slaves to you."
 EC_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We consider ourselves progressive-minded. Anyone can be a master, anyone can join the ranks of the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] fleets and become a feared captain. But it seems that the spineless [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] can never be a master, only a slave."
 EC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We are a nation of slavers and pirates, and take no shame in that. However, we also consider ourselves traders and men of culture and diplomacy. If you treat us with respect, we shall do the same to you."
 EC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Are you here to purchase some slaves? Come one, come all! Slaves from the furthest corners of the galaxy. Strong, strapling guards to protect you! Exotic, beautiful slaves skilled in the art of lovemaking! Intelligent, literate bondservants to help with your daily administrative needs! We have it all!"
 EC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Ah, we were expecting you. It is true we have a few [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves on sale. If you wish to purchase their freedom, just have your money ready and I will be more than happy to help you."
 EC_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Your ships threaten our trade routes and ability to launch raids. It is not a good situation for the [Root.GetName], but we've seen worse!"
 EC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Good friend! Come, join us and eat some delicacies before we get to business - some of the most delicious of delights from the most exotic corners of the galaxy. We're quite good at acquiring these, and I'm more than happy to give you some to take home with you if you so wish!"
 EC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Rest assured that our leader, [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName], has stipulated that any [From.GetSpeciesName] wrongly captured as a slave shall be immediately set free. It is the least we can do to ensure that our good, profitable relations will remain so, for your friendship is important to us."
 EC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Who are your enemies, dear [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friend? Tell us where they are, and we shall consider raiding their worlds for slaves. If we are successful, we shall sell you those slaves for very low prices!"
 EC_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesName] shall all be enslaved! Hahaha! Why stop now? We will acquire so many slaves from this war, the profits shall be endless!"
 EC_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Would you like some exotic sweets, good enemy of ours? They are not poisoned, we guarantee. Just a courtesy. You'll all be our slaves soon, anyways, so it's not that much a loss to us."
 EC_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Many of our brave and sly warriors are instructed to seize any [From.GetSpeciesName] they see so that they could be sold on the slave markets. Such are the customs of war for the [Root.GetName]!"

 SLS_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We value bravery even among our enemies and rivals, but sometimes I'm not sure whether the warriors of the [From.GetName] have any. I'm sure they have a little bit of courage... somehow."
 SLS_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Ha, if it isn't the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]s. Why don't we have a contest between our mightiest warriors to see who is stronger? It will admitedly be an unfair match, given how much stronger the [Root.GetSpeciesName] is, so I'm sure ours will win by a long shot."
 SLS_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Be careful, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Your merchants are not welcome in the [From.GetName]. Who knows if someone might want to... steal their valuable goods."
 SLS_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We are the true lords of the galaxy. Born of the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] slave warrior castes, we were meant to rule. But the [From.GetName]... ha! What weaklings."
 SLS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Remember that though our most esteemed ruler, [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName], was born of the slave castes, all our leaders are, so do not look down on us as a nation of slaves. There is no shame in being a slave among the [Root.GetSpeciesName] so long as you prove yourself a worthy warrior and leader."
 SLS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We believe that it is better to be a valorous slave than a cowardly master. Would the [From.GetSpeciesName] agree?"
 SLS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Our rulers hail from the caste of warrior slaves. They have been taught to fight and to lead since birth. It is why [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] warriors are among the greatest in the galaxy."
 SLS_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Do not scorn us merely because we are ruled by slave lords, [From.GetSpeciesName]! We have bravery and honor - can you say the same?"
 SLS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "It is good to see you friend! Many [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] say they wish to test their arms against [From.GetSpeciesAdj] warriors, for it is said that the soldiers of [From.GetName] are among the best in the galaxy!"
 SLS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Whenever we look across the vast galaxy, there are few we hold in higher regard than the [From.GetName]. To impress the slave lords of the [Root.GetName] is quite a feat."
 SLS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Your merchants are always welcome in the [Root.GetName]. We will do our best to ensure they are protected. We are as honorable and just as we are brave and strong."
 SLS_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "This is a trial of strength! There is no time for talking. Our slave warriors shall best the greatest of your armies."
 SLS_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Come now! Have a little bit more courage! There's no need to stop the fighting yet."
 SLS_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "I would be careful if I were you, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Our warrior slaves have been trained since birth to fight and to kill. Your leaders may have been born free, but what use is that freedom if they can't defend it? That is why we will win in the end."

 # Warrior Mystics
 WM_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "How incessant is the rambling of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]! Silence is like the vastness of the universe. Speech is but the life span of a mere planet."
 WM_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "We must coexist in harmony, but you try our patience, o [From.GetSpeciesName]. Sometimes, we must make exceptions."
 WM_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "The world is full of darkness, and much of that comes from the [From.GetName]."
 WM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Every [From.GetSpeciesName] I have ever met was full of impatience and a lack of wisdom. It is little wonder that the [From.GetName] lacks strength and prestige in the galactic community."

 WM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesName] were born to travel through the stars. Why would anyone prefer to crawl through life?"
 WM_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Do you come to seek the truth of the universe? So do we. We will contemplate, we will fight, we will love, so long as it is a means to gain better understanding. Yes, you possess much worldly strength. But never underestimate the weak."
 WM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Friend, if you are ever wholly perplexed and in straits, have patience, for patience is the key to joy. We are here to help you, likewise, so whenever you need assistance, never be afraid to call on us."

 WM_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "The darkness in the hearts of every [From.GetSpeciesName] is disconcerting. It is something we must fight against."
 WM_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Death is but a fleeting experience. This war, too, will end one day, and be a mere memory in the minds of both [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] and [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural]."
 WM_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Our warriors are not only mighty and strong, but full of wisdom, patience, and compassion. That is why they are the envy of the galaxy, and that is why our victory against the forces of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] darkness is inevitable."

 AP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "The galaxy is filled with children waiting to grow and mature. Will you join us in guiding these younger races to fulfill their destiny, or will you choose the path of hostility and aggression? If it is the latter, we will do whatever we can to protect our children."

 # Depraved Breeders
 DB_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "How dare you look down on us. We enjoy the act of copulation. You do not, and for that the [From.GetName] is full of close-minded, bigoted prudes."
 DB_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Breed with you? What are we, perverts? That's too much, even for us, and that's saying something."
 DB_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "We like to think that every species has its own unique beauty that must be admired, but we find it hard to think of anything positive or beautiful about the hideous [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Engaging in intimate relations with the likes of you would be humiliating."
 DB_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "You are disgusting. So disgusting even the most desperate [Root.GetSpeciesName] wouldn't want to breed with you. Haven't we told you already that we've rejected your affections?"
 DB_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "You all are such prudes. You can't enjoy pleasure for pleasure's sake, and repress your lust for no reason at all. We, on the other hand, are in constant euphoria, not because of some outdated morals, but because we are enlightened by our acceptance of our base desires."
 DB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "You seem very innocent and naive. A little too innocent and naive. It is so tempting to corrupt such innocence..."
 DB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We believe that intimacy is an important part of any relationship. Do you agree?"
 DB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are known throughout the galaxy for being the best lovers. We can show you our abilities, if you like..."
 DB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Hopefully you are aware, but we can be very satisfying partners, the best partners you'll ever have... if you cooperate with us."
 DB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "Yes, there are many little [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] running around. We enjoy making [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural]. Is that so hard to undersetand?"
 DB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Intimate relations is much better than war when it comes to solving problems, don't you think? If only the rest of the galaxy believed more in the ideals of love to be shared among all..."
 DB_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "If you want to know, we don't mind things getting rough, just remember to be a little gentle with us, alright?"
 DB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We always enjoy it when you come here. Perhaps we should continue in the bedroom?"
 DB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "We've heard that your skills in love rival our own... would you like to have a contest to compare our abilities?"
 DB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "You know what we always like seeing? When attractive diplomats from the [From.GetName] come. Come visit us, I mean."
 DB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "I don't mind letting my [Root.GetSpeciesMouthName] get to know your [From.GetSpeciesMouthName] a little better. If you catch my drift."

 DIE_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Why are the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] always so rushed? Why do you spend so much time worrying about power and glory? Such arrogance and ignorance! You must learn to calm yourself, see the brightness of the stars and the darkness of the night for what they are, and not as material resources to be exploited."
 DIE_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Ha! You think yourself so mighty with your fleets and your abundant cities and planets. Our lives are so short, friend, don't you know? Your efforts will all be in vain, for one day it will all be swallowed up by the eternal void of the universe."

 DIE_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "You may think you are so powerful with your fancy lasers and ships. Think again. It takes understanding and wisdom to win wars, not strength."
 DIE_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "How vain for you to think you can defeat the [Root.GetName]. Just because everything is impermanent does not mean we have given up hope. It only inspires us to fight harder, so that we may defend what little we have."

 HP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Our lives are so meaningless and full of despair... why do you have to make it worse?"
 HP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Your foolish idealism will be your downfall. This universe has no place for your saccharine notions of optimism."
 HP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "It seems your idealism has rendered you weak and incapable. A cynical outlook is needed to survive in this universe."
 HP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] seem to possess so much optimism. How can someone be so full of hope in a universe filled with grim darkness?"
 HP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Yes, we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are a cynical lot. Don't let that prevent you from dealing honorably with us. We are not nihilists, and don't take kindly to tyrants, bullies, and morons."
 HP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "What's the point about doing anything? It's all pointless in the end. There will be conflict and chaos, death and destruction, suffering and stupidity in this universe. But very well, let's see what you wish of us."
 HP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Maybe it was our fate to be dominated by the tyrannical [From.GetName]. It probably was. Such are the woes of existence."

 COF_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "I wonder how the average [From.GetSpeciesName] consumes food with their [From.GetSpeciesOrganName]. It is fascinating."
 COF_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Don't look down on us just because you think our food is primitive. It's an acquired taste."

 # Melodious Composers
 MC_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Look upon the weary travelers who have come to our borders. You ruffians from the [From.GetName] are of lowly character, and do not deserve to hear the heavenly sounds of our music."
 MC_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Ha! To think that you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] believe you actually have any semblance of culture! Your so-called 'music' is nothing more than the cacophony that comes from a putrid, rotting [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] [From.GetSpeciesOrganName]."
 MC_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Why do you even talk to us? It is more pleasurable to listen to a deaf musician than to hear your speech."
 MC_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "What works of art does the [From.GetName] have to contribute to the greater galactic community? Look upon us [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] - our lovely and miraculous music is beloved by all!"
 MC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "All the galaxy has heard of the great music of the [Root.GetName]. Our melodies are melodic, our grooves are groovy, our beats beat with the spirit of a million [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] dancing to the same rhythm."
 MC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "It is in music that the [Root.GetSpeciesName] finds their truest calling. For it is music that speaks to our souls, that inspires passion, that causes us to feel sadness, that allows us to celebrate life and death, that brings us closer to the truth of the universe. Do you agree?"
 MC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Music is the art of song, it is the art of love and hate, of sadness and happiness, of emotion and rationality, of triumph and defeat, of light and dark... it is the art of truth. The [Root.GetSpeciesName] lives to understand this truth."
 MC_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "You sing a song of arrogance and unbridled power, but beware! The song of our people is one of hope and inner strength that can never be squashed."
 MC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "The song of the [Root.GetName] and the song of the [From.GetName] are not so different. Let our two peoples sing together in harmony and perfect unison, our friendship a beautiful duet that will make all rival nations look upon with envy!"
 MC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy, but friendship such as that among the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] is highest of all."
 MC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "The music of the [From.GetSpeciesName] is most pleasurable, of an excellent quality, unmatched in depth and thought (except when compared to our own of course), and highly recommended to all music-loving patrons of the galaxy."
 MC_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Hear you not the drums of war beating, fiend? Hear you not the fierce chanting of our warriors? Hear you not the wailing cries of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] people as our fleets come to destroy your planets? This is the music of our war!"
 MC_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are as skilled in music as we are in war."
 MC_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Our generals are like conductors - the symphonies they conduct are the explosions that will riddle your planets, the missiles and lasers that will pierce your ships, the fire that will burn your soldiers alive."

 # Cosmopolitan Imperials
 CI_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Know that [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] living in the [Root.GetName] are treated with dignity and respect, even if we find it hard to do so."
 CI_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The only reason we speak is because our refusal would cause a diplomatic incident between our two peoples."
 CI_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Ah, the [From.GetName]. Some in the galaxy call you heroes. But heroes don't use their power to break galactic law, oppress helpless innocents, and establish tyrannical, iron-fisted rule over countless stars and planets."
 CI_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Come now, don't be shy. You haven't come this far just to stand there gawking at our majesty."
 CI_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "The skies are marked with numberless sparks, each a fire, and every one a sign. Our scholars know these stars well, and we wonder... which sign marked the birth of your species?"
 CI_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We are a civilized race who respect the rule of law and we expect the same from fellow nations."
 CI_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are the [Root.GetName]. The [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are citizens of the galaxy, and the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] as well, and we all serve it in our own ways."
 CI_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Who now will save us from the coming darkness?"
 CI_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Hail, friends! How may we assist you today? The [Root.GetName] stands strong alongside its allies, for as long as the stars burn in the skies."
 CI_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Together, our two peoples are the future overlords of the galaxy and will serve as its rightful rulers. Without both of us to keep order, the galaxy would fall into barbarism and lawlessness."
 CI_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Regardless of your path through history, our scholars sense in the [From.GetName] a certain ambition. This ambition can be useful, friend, but it can also be a danger if wielded unskillfully."
 CI_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Ah, you think our soldiers cowards? We disagree. [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are but the dust of the stars. They know their doom, and honorably face their apportioned fate, then fall."
 CI_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We've seen fresh [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] recruits with more skill than your armies!"
 CI_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "You started this war, plunged the galaxy into chaos, and now the [Root.GetName] is going to put you down and restore the peace."
 # Vassal greetings
 CI_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "It is clear the [Root.GetName] is not as strong as it once was. [From.GetSpeciesAdj] masters, your destiny calls you down a different road, however. Help us, and we shall help you."

 CI_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName]! You are guilty of violating galactic law, murder of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] citizens, and conspiracy against the [Root.GetName]. It's over!"
 CI_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! In the name of [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName], we request your leaders stand down and face public execution, or advance and face summary execution by our soldiers. It matters little to us. Either way we'll be sending your heads back to [Root.GetHomeWorldName]."
 
 
  
 # Builders of Paradise
 BOP_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "What are scholarship, love, and mercy when compared to fate, night and destruction? You walk the path of defeat and sorrow, [From.GetSpeciesName]!"
 BOP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Why do you think the stars have always been contested ground, the arena of mortals and immortals alike? It is the realm of change, brother to madness, sister to deceit, and, one day, we intend to liberate it from you, and return it to its rightful masters - us."
 BOP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "So, the cat's paw of the false gods and cowardly kings arrive again. You didn't think you could take us unawares, here of all places? In the paradise we created? Look now upon our paradise, [Root.GetHomeWorldName] in the old tongue, a vision of the past, and the future."
 BOP_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "Your false gods cannot entirely rewrite history. They know us as the bringers of paradise, of the fire that will purge the galaxy of falsehood and deceit. Worship our gods, or be eradicated in our quest to restore the universe to its natural state!"
 BOP_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "How is it that our gods forthrightly proclaim themselves to all, while your gods cower behind statues and the faithless words of traitor-priests? It is simple... your gods are not gods at all. The truth has been in front of you since your species first became sentient: our gods are the true gods of this universe."
 BOP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We fault not your stumbling, for it is expected. We crave not your downfalls, though without them you might surpass us even in the coming galaxy of all infinities. Our gods wish the [From.GetName] no ills but the momentous."
 BOP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Woe to the oath-breakers! We are not fooled by the forlorn that ride astray the roadway, for they lost faith and this losing was caused by their false gods."
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Behold the [Root.GetName], where the disciples of truth are tempered for a higher destiny, to rule over a galaxy reborn. Will you join us as we recreate paradise, or will you be a last defender of a decadent reality?"
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Our gods will walk the galaxy again. Reality shall be remade. A new age shall rise from the ashes of the old. Our vision shall be realized. Weakness will be purged from the world, and mortal and immortal alike purified in the refiner's fire."
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Endeth we seek through our Dawn, all endeth. Falter now and become one with the wayside orphans that feed us. Follow and the [Root.GetName] shall adore you from inside."
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "The sphere of destruction is but the milk of the unenslaved."
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "The true gods would only have those clever enough to pause, all else the chaos claims in their foolish running. Walk first. Heed. The impatience you feel is your first slave to behead if you wish to learn the true nature of things."
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "The universe is just one more realm of our gods, long lost when they were betrayed by those that served them."
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] were once you, asleep, unwise, protonymic, but are no more. "
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_08:0 "Hear now the words of our gods, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]: "When hell walks the galaxy again, the faithful shall receive their reward: to be set above all other mortals forever. As for the rest... the weak shall be winnowed, the timid shall be cast down, the mighty shall tremble at our feet and pray for pardon.""
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_09:0 "The walls of reality will soon crumble. The new dawn grows nearer with every rift in the firmament. Soon, very soon, the lines now blurred will be erased and the galaxy reborn!"
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_10:0 "Whosoever findeth the truth, we shall call him brothers and sisters. Answers are liberations."
 BOP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We do not fear you, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Paradise awaits us!"
 BOP_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Well done, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] champions! You think we mock you? Not at all. You are the great defender of a decadent reality. We are the midwife of a new dawn, a galaxy reborn. We welcome you, if you truly are the agent of Fate. We tire of self-styled heroes who set themselves in our path, only to prove unworthy in the event."
 BOP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Greet the new day, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] brothers and sisters. A new dawn shall soon rise over the galaxy, and we its masters."
 BOP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Praise be to you, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] brothers and sisters. Great shall be your reward in Paradise! Now we sit and wait to feast with you on all the worlds of this cosmos. Rejoice in the promise of paradise! Liberty!"
 BOP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Feel uplifted in thine heart that you have our friendship, for together we shall strike high and low into the wormrot of false heavens."
 BOP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Praise be to our [From.GetSpeciesAdj] brothers and sisters! Praise be to paradise! Liberty!"
 BOP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "From palace, hut, or cave, our peoples have left all the fog worlds of conception behind. Liberty! Rejoice in the promise of paradise!"
 BOP_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "How little you understand! You cannot stop our armies. The stars have sparkled as gems in the black reaches of the night sky for aeons. We cannot invade the galaxy, our birthright! We come to liberate these occupied lands!"
 BOP_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Paradise awaits us! Let all Chaos know itself to be free! [Root.GetName] is come! There is no dominion save free will!"
 BOP_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Die, unbeliever! Our gods will welcome your souls in hell!"
 BOP_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "The time of cleansing draws nigh."
 BOP_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "We scorn traitors and fear not. We call them names and call out their base natures. Our gods are with us, and will come to take you to paradise where the traitors shall hang on glass wracks until they smile with the new revolution."
 # Vassal greetings
 BOP_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "You may be our masters for now, but know that we still worship and serve the true gods."
 # Declaration of War
 BOP_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! We have waited a long time for you, champions of the old universe. You are the last gasp of a dying age. You breathe the stale air of false hope."
 BOP_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! Our long duel with the [From.GetName] will soon be over, and we have the mastery. [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] shall die and [From.GetHomeWorldName] shall be ours."
 BOP_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! The defenders of the ragged, dying galaxy stand before us, in the heart of our power. Let us see who at last has proved the stronger!"
 
 
  
 # Sadistic Loremasters
 SL_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We are the mighty [Root.GetName] and our lore is our greatest weapon. You [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], so ignorant and vile, are worthy of only being our slaves."
 SL_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Who dares enter the forbidden halls of the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]? Begone! Stand aside! I should have your [From.GetSpeciesOrganName] ripped out from all of you if you dare bother us!"
 SL_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "You who are as worthless as slaves, why do you come before us? Perhaps we should immolate your [From.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] as a demonstration?"
 SL_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "The dark night, so thunderous, so mighty, heralds the lordly [Root.GetSpeicesNamePlural]. Fear us, and know our power."
 SL_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Our [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] ancestors heard the welcoming gifts of peace in the streams and the flora of [Root.GetHomeWorldName], and it is there that we made our home."
 SL_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "You may have heard rumors that we torture our slaves and that our artisans use their entrails to make works of art. Those rumors are entirely correct. Those debased creatures are but animals, anyways, lacking in wisdom and knowledge of lore, that we have no moral qualms about it."
 SL_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "In [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] society, rebellious slaves are given the most compassionate of punishments, for they are placed in 'wailing wheels,' 'gut gardens,' and 'flesh-sculptures' for all [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to admire."
 SL_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Those who master lore are masters of the stars. It is clear that you possess some knowledge of lore, but do not let your hubris be your undoing."
 SL_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "In the caverns of lore, ugly and obscure, shines the gold of truth. Wear lore as your armor, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends. The galaxy is ancient and full of dangers."
 SL_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Bless and blessed be, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends. The many races that litter this galaxy are, for the most part, inferior of worth and lacking in judgment, but we find the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to be the exception. Let us share lore and understand the secrets of reality."
 SL_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Come, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends, we have entertainment to show you. What you call torture we call art. Feast your eyes on the visually pleasing design of our slaves' entrails and blood, smeared across purest stone. Or perhaps would you prefer to hear their screams, a symphony to the ears?"
 SL_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Wisdom learned by pain is a reliable guide in these dark times."
 SL_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "By what power do you follow us here? Our reach is long and our fleets mighty. We do not fear you!"

 TN_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Don't lie to us! We know you're in on the conspiracy against the [Root.GetName]!"
 TN_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Who are the ones leading the conspiracy.... Is it you, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] 'friends'? We have undoubtedly earned your enmity by our vigilance numerous times."
 TN_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "We've been watching you from [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. You [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] pretend to work, but we can tell that you are really watching our every move, plotting our downfall."
 TN_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "Could [From.GetHomeWorldName] be the headquarters of the conspiracy?"
 TN_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Who... are you? We don't know any [From.GetName]. Yes, we don't. Were you looking for the way to the center of the galaxy?"
 TN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We don't really feel comfortable talking to the [From.GetName] right now. "
 TN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Really? You're not conspiring against us? Hmmm.... The intentions of our galactic enemies are stranger than we thought..."
 TN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Psst! Over here! Yes, you! We need to talk!"
 TN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "We need to learn more about the [From.GetName]! Obscure hints from various sources suggest you could be the most dangerous of our rivals. The question, though: why do you want us dead?"
 TN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "The [From.GetName] is not involved in the conspiracy! At least so you tell us. We hope it is true, but [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] instincts are rarely wrong. But we have no reason to suspect treachery, yet."
 TN_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We can't be seen negotiating! What if they discover us? Unless if you were them, all along?"
 TN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Good, good. We think we can trust the [From.GetName]. Nobody else in the galaxy. They're all in on it ... all watching us, watching our every move."
 TN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Thanks to friends like you, the sinister plans of the galaxy's conspiracy have now been revealed to us."
 TN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Here you go, friends, take these trinkets as a token of our appreciation. Trust us, with everyone in the galaxy conspiring against us, you've earned it. There is one issue that needs looking into, though."
 TN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Our enemies are brazen now. Think we are as good as caught in their net. We must strike back before it's too late, friend! But are desperate measures called for yet? Do we have enough proof to justify acting?"
 TN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "Friend, we must gather evidence against our enemies, and the conspiracy will at last be laid bare. If we can preserve the element of surprise, we may still have a chance!"
 TN_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "And to think that we trusted you! We all know the truth, though, that the [From.GetName] war machine is funded by the galactic conspiracy!"
 TN_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetName] MUST be xenocided! There is no choice, you are definitely conspiring against us."
 TN_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "And so it all falls into place... yes, yes, it all makes sense now. And to think we trusted you!"
 TN_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "We have very little doubt now that you are one of them. This saddens us. We had thought the [From.GetName] as one of the few to show us kindness in this galaxy of treachery. But now it seems that it was all a lie."
 TN_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "We fear that the end is near. But we will not go down without a fight! The conspiracy will know that the [Root.GetName], at least, did not submit to their yoke quietly!"
 # Vassal greetings
 TN_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Good day, master! We have to wonder, what price betrayal ... never mind that. We shall see what your intentions are..."
 TN_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "With a master like you, we may still have a chance. The [From.GetName] can help us. A powerful, mighty stranger who can move freely. Hopefully we will have proof against the galactic conspiracy by the end of the century!"
 TN_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "If our master finds proof of our enemies' guilt, we can finally take decisive action against the galactic conspiracy's agents with a clear conscience."
 # Declaration of War
 TN_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Just as we suspected! They've gotten to the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] too! Now we know for sure that the galaxy is all in on the conspiracy against the [Root.GetName]. And therefore they all have to die - starting with you!"

 POM_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Since you're standing here, we assume you're here to negotiate. Or you're terribly confused. OR REALLY LACKING IN GOOD JUDGMENT!"
 POM_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Leave. Quickly. Before we get bored. You wouldn't like us when we're bored."
 POM_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "The [Root.GetName] is our realm, remember? Our creation, our place, our rules."
 POM_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "You call us [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] fools? Nay, we are visionaries! Change is in the air. Breathe it deep! Bathe in its scent! Bottle it up. Save some for later."
 POM_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "You have a message for us? Really? Ooh, ooh, what kind of message? Well? Spit it out, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. We haven't got an eternity! But seriously. What's the message?"
 POM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Look at you. No concept of what you've stumbled into. No sense of place. You don't even really know where you are, do you? Few really do, but that's beside the point."
 POM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "You love asking us about the [Root.GetName] don't you. Aren't you the curious one? You know what they say about curiosity, though, don't you? It killed the lesser, inferior nations of this galaxy that deserved xenocide."
 POM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "Hold your tongue, little [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult], or we'll tear it from your [From.GetSpeciesMouthName]."
 POM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "A change is coming. Everything changes. Even the [Root.GetName]. Especially the [Root.GetName]."
 POM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Change will preserve us! It is the lifeblood of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. It will move mountains! It will mount movements!"
 POM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are the [Root.GetName], led by the benevolent mad rule of [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]. Among other things. We're not talking about them. You've probably figured that out by now."
 POM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "[Root.GetHomeWorldName], [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. A wonderful place! Except when it's horrible. Then it's horribly wonderful. Good for a visit. Or for an eternity."
 POM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Yes? Speaking to us? We are them. Them are us. And others, as well. Or, they were. Weren't they?"
 POM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "Is the [From.GetName] a friend or foe? So, which is it? What will it be? Friend? Foe? Answer us already. The suspense is killing us. Or you, if we have to keep waiting."
 POM_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Have you any idea where you are? Where you truly are? Welcome to the deceptively verdant realm of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]! We've seen better times, but maybe you'd care to help?"
 POM_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Yes, yes, you all are entirely brilliant. Conquering millions of star systems and all that. Blah blah blah. But you're not done yet. And you could still die."
 POM_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "We have been minding our own business, leaving you to conquer the galaxy. So, you ask, how is this mind business? Good question!"
 POM_THREATENED_GREETING_04:0 "Someday we'll be stronger you. We can't stand losing. And we don't mind cheating."
 POM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "An old friend! We're so happy, we could just tear out your intestines and strangle you with them."
 POM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Take this holy trinket. Perhaps it will serve the [From.GetName] well. Or look lovely on your corpses."
 POM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "What heroes the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are! You should be off like the wind, solving problems and doing good deeds! And if not good deeds, then deeds of a sort. Strongholds to save, and [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to rescue."
 POM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "You are far too hard on yourself, our dear, sweet, xenocidally insane [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends. What would the galaxy's denizens do without you? Dance? Sing? Smile? Grow old? "
 POM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "You are the best race that's ever existed in the universe."
 POM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_06:0 "Oh, we are so happy for you! My, what a burden you must have carried."
 POM_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Ah, what a lovely war this is! At least we know your intentions. Cat's out of the bag on that one, isn't it? Who puts cats in bags, anyway? Cats hate bags!"

 FOW_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Do not mock and scorn us for our ways. Remember that it is through the blood of our sacrifices that the universe still stands as it does. Without our efforts, all creation will come to an end."
 FOW_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We know that your armies are weak. But if your warriors have courage and shrewdness, then if we were to ever sacrifice them upon our altars, the gods will consider their deaths to be worthwhile. Even the smallest of flowers has a beauty to it."
 FOW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Learn to venerate the gods properly, [From.GetSpeciesName]. If you do not, how will the universe continue to live as it always had? We alone cannot provide the gods with the sustenance they need."
 FOW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Some say we sacrifice any sentient being as part of our spiritual practices. They are absolutely correct. Whether it is [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] blood or [From.GetSpeciesAdj] blood, the Gods care not. A flower is beautiful no matter its origin, a sacrifice is honorable no matter its origin."
 FOW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Our warriors have been taught from birth in the martial arts. It is important that they honor the gods, and their ancestors, through their heroic deeds. If our two nations ever come to blows, we hope the soldiers of the [From.GetName] will prove a worthy foe."
 FOW_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Be careful, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Your pride might be your downfall. Remember that it is only through blood sacrifices that the universe will continue to exist."
 FOW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] take our duties seriously. Without us, who will be there to give blood sacrifices so that the universe can continue existing? We are glad to count the [From.GetName] among those who help us with our task."
 FOW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Ah, it is none other than our friends from [From.GetName]! I assume you came here to join us in watching the great spectacle that is [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] sports? The winners will have the honor of being sacrificed to the gods, so the athletes are trying their hardest to win."
 FOW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Our warriors always prepare for war. It is essential that they prove themselves worthy in combat, so they can capture enemy soldiers to be used as blood sacrifices. As our trusted friends, we hope your warriors are equally capable as ours."
 FOW_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Be joyful, dearest [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! Every one of your warriors we capture in battle is sacrificed before the altars of the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] deities - their blood shall give new life to the universe, like young flowers blooming anew!"
 FOW_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Most impressive. Your warriors have proven their mettle in battle with their strength and cunning. It will be an honor to capture them and sacrifice them before our gods. Soldiers are but like beautiful flowers, living and dying under the rule of the benevolent universe."
 FOW_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We look forward to fighting against the [From.GetName], for our brave and cunning warriors will acquire a great number of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] captives for our blood sacrifices. It is absolutely necessary in order to ensure the continued existence of the universe."
 # Vassal greetings
 FOW_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "We pay homage to you, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] masters. Several [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have volunteered themselves for the blood sacrifice in your honor. They shall be the flowers that shine in the light of the majesty that is your sun."
 # Declaration of War
 FOW_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! It is time we fight the courageous [From.GetName]. Worry not - if we capture any of you warriors in battle, know that they will be given the most luxurious of treatment before being sacrificed before our gods."
 
 
  
 # Nonaligned Preservationists
 NP_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The behavior of the [From.GetName] is an affront to the galactic community. In your greed for power and riches, it seems to us that you are incapable of showing restraint and respecting the natural way of things."
 NP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetName] is wary of your constant meddling in other nations' affairs. There is no shame in upholding the balance of the galaxy through force, but your interventionism is a danger to all, including yourselves."
 NP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Have you no respect for the natural order of things? The [From.GetName] seems unconcerned for protecting the environment nor respecting the sovereignty of every sentient species."
 NP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "So long as you keep to yourselves and do not contest our dedication to a stable, conflict-free galaxy, we shall pose no threat to you. But we doubt you would be able to do much to us."
 NP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "The [Root.GetName] prefers not to get involved in others' affairs. So long as you do not disturb our peace, nor that of other species or star systems, then we can avoid conflict."
 NP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "As every sentient species has a right to live in accordance with its normal cultural evolution, no [Root.GetSpeciesName] may interfere with the healthy development of alien life and culture. Such interference includes introducing superior knowledge, strength, or technology to a society incapable of handling them wisely."
 NP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Every world is defined by its particular boundaries, within which some understanding of reality emerges as truth. Two truths cannot coexist, and so from the introduction of foreign bodies is conflict and chaos spawns. That's why we limit our involvement in local affairs."
 NP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Might and influence might be yours, [From.GetSpeciesName], but remember not to be tempted by the lure of power. We believe it is still your moral necessity that you do not disturb the natural way of things."
 NP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Friend, we are glad that you agree with our views. It is difficult trying to ensure everyone in the galaxy respects the sovereignty of every species and takes care not to disturb the delicate balance of the galaxy's ecosystem."
 NP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "The galaxy's ecological diversity is, in a sense, sacred. As we are all in a sense connected, it is imperative that our two peoples work together to protect it from crimes against nature."
 NP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "The [Root.GetName] believes that the galaxy's diverse ecology is worth protecting and the sovereign right of every sentient species to develop at its own pace."
 NP_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Do not believe for a moment that our soldiers are weak because we have a neutral foreign policy. Quite the contrary, we have learned from observing the petty squabbles of others."
 NP_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We do not believe war is enjoyable, nor is it desirable, but every [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] soldier knows that they are fighting for a higher cause."
 NP_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "After this war is over, we hope you will come to your senses and stop your needless meddling in foreign affairs and ecosystems."

 # Inspired Dreamers
 ID_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We believe that every [From.GetSpeciesName] can achieve their dreams and perfect their bodies, minds, and souls if you all just put in some hard work and stop complaining."
 ID_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Those who look for easy answers will only find trouble. The [From.GetName] needs to stop assuming there are shortcuts in life, because there are none in the development of individuals or civilizations."
 ID_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Why do the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] insist on finding the easy way out? You cannot create beauty or intelligence or success through artificial means - they must be acquired naturally through diligence, commitment, and staying true to yourselves!"
 ID_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] learn from [From.GetSpeciesNameAdj] mistakes, for you are an entire society seemingly dedicated to improving yourself through deception and finding the easy way out, instead of actually working on your goals. It has clearly not resulted in the best for you given the paltry state of the [From.GetName]."
 ID_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Fake it until you make it is what we always tell our [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural]. If you don't ever try, how do you know you'll ever make it? So tell us what you want, then, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Maybe we'll turn you down, maybe we won't. It's up to you to take the risk, no one else."
 ID_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have worked hard for centuries to perfect ourselves. We are born with problems and imperfections, all of us, but as long as we stay true to ourselves and never give up, we can achieve anything we set our minds to."
 ID_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "You know what the secret to life is? It's staying true to yourself. Ignore what others think. If the [From.GetName] and [Root.GetName] does what is true to the hearts of our people, who knows what can be accomplished? Only great things, we're certain."
 ID_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We wish we could assume that the [From.GetName] worked hard, but it's hard to tell. Only those who stay true to themselves will win in the end. That's how it's always been, so the day of your reckoning will come, and perhaps it'll be sooner than you think."
 ID_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We are taught to believe in ourselves from a young age, and believe in those who are good at heart. We believe in the [From.GetName]. We believe it can do great things for the galaxy, great things for everyone living in it."
 ID_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "What doesn't kill you make you stronger. The citizens of [Root.GetName] have long admired the tenacity and determination of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] soul. You set an example for all the galaxy who wish to better themselves."
 ID_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "It's clear why the [From.GetName] is such a great nation. Instead of deluding yourselves with artificial displays of strength and beauty, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] proudly display their true authentic selves, with all the good and all the flaws that come with it. By being true to yourselves, you have unleashed your inner power."
 ID_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "You miss a hundred percent of the shots you don't take. [From.GetSpeciesAdj] ships also miss a hundred percent of the shots they take due to the incompetence of their soldiers."
 ID_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "No one said fighting would be easy. Our warriors will give a hundred and one percent, and that's how we'll win this war."
 ID_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We've worked hard, we've always worked hard. We know we will not claim victory against you unless we put in our best effort. Our soldiers are working hard, every day, to do everything in their power against your regime."
 # Vassal greetings
 ID_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "We have much to learn from you, [From.GetSpeciesName], about the values of hard work and believing in yourself. Only then can we achieve greatness."
 # Declaration of War
 ID_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! If you're not a part of the solution, then you're a part of the problem. The [From.GetName] has for too long, through false gestures of pleasantry and friendship, prevented the rest of the galaxy from reaching its true potential. It is time you are taught a lesson."
 
  
 # Cultivated Scholar-Gentry
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The customs and language of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are not like those of the [Root.GetSpeciesName]. You barbarians know not the proper rituals, nor what is correct and incorrect behavior. How could you ever consider yourselves civilized?"
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "When we see nations of worth, we think of equaling them. When we see nations of a contrary character, we turn inwards and examine ourselves. Witnessing the corruption, decadence, and dishonor emanating from the [From.GetName], we have learned what to not become."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "The [From.GetName] is like a country full of wicked youths, who act no better than brigands with little direction and a thirst for blood and riches. "
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "What separates [From.GetName] from the barbarians of old? That is a question many of our scholars ponder, and it is clear that perhaps there is no difference at all."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "When one hears the eloquent language of our poetry, one cannot help but weep when the emotions are provoked, and sigh at its penetrating insights. When one hears the pedestrian poetry of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], one cannot help but weep at its deficient quality, and sigh at its cliches and banality."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "Beware! Your people suffer under your brutal punishments and cruel rulers. Will the [From.GetName] not heed the lessons of the past? Tyrants have always met terrible ends! If it is not [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] who falls, perhaps it will be their successor."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_07:0 "The [From.GetName] are corrupt. Years of idleness have ruined you. A true gentleman pays homage to virtue and the learned arts first and foremost, but he also pays homage to the martial arts. Your idealism has been merely an excuse for laziness."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_08:0 "To study and not think is a waste. To think and not study is dangerous. Clearly, the [From.GetName] believes itself the latter. Your blind worship of knowledge lacks wisdom and clarity and for this surely you will suffer."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_09:0 "To throw oneself into strange teachings is quite dangerous. The [From.GetName], in its self-righteousness, believes the teachings of its sages superior to all others. This is called arrogance. Our sages have taught, conversely, that there is wisdom to be found everywhere."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_10:0 "What pride and vanity! The [From.GetName] sees itself as better than all and does not know the pleasure in conversing with talented and virtuous friends, and for that your lives are all the more empty and meaningless."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_11:0 "They who befriend the troublesome and wicked will themselves adopt those traits in time. The [From.GetName] is too friendly, and cannot distinguish between superior and inferior friends. This is a flaw and a danger. Beware the inferior, and cherish the superior!"
 CSG_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "The cautious seldom err, our sages teach us. The [Root.GetName] dwarfs the [From.GetName] in all matters, whether it is the power of our armies, the prosperity of our cities, or the wisdom of our sages, but we do not underestimate you. On the contrary, we are certain you may be stronger than you appear."
 CSG_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Though you appear weak on the outside, we should not underestimate the potential threat your people pose should you rise again. We only hope that if you regain your strength that you do not unleash any vengeance on us."
 CSG_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "It seems to us that the poets of [From.GetName] are lacking in talent and creativity. Would you like us to send some of our poets over to teach your poets the proper methods and skills needed to produce worthy compositions?"
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "If, like us, you consider yourselves gentlemen and gentlewomen of virtuous spirit and noble learning, then we can coexist in harmony and perhaps even be friends."
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Let us share a drink of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] tea, and recite the most eloquent and moving poetry our nations' poets have composed, before comparing them to see which is the superior. "
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We in the [Root.GetName] consider ourselves to be those who have proper learning and morals."
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "A gentleman is one who carefully focuses his or her actions, who accumulates knowledge and wisdom, who takes joy in the simple pleasures of the arts, who is humble and kind, who seeks not glory and violence, but learning and peace. Can you say the [From.GetName] encourages these values?"
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Perhaps we should have a contest between our finest musicians. It seems prudent to see who has the more pleasing music!"
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "All down the ages rings the note of change, for fate so rules it and none escapes its sway. The [From.GetName] and [Root.GetName] shall vanish as a dream one day, useless misery is ours to grieve."
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "The greatest pleasure is to meet with friends and engage in pleasant conversation, recite poetry, and listen to the music of old. We hope your people share these sentiments."
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_08:0 "To know what you know, and to know what you do not know - this is true wisdom. What do the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] know? What do the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] not know?"
 CSG_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! The great [From.GetName]. Clearly you are like the powerful lords of old. Be careful, though, if you grow too arrogant, you may undo your accomplishments."
 CSG_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "You may possess more weapons than us. But can you match us in music, poetry, or music?"
 CSG_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "The cautious seldom err, our sages teach us. The [From.GetName] dwarfs the [Root.GetName] in all matters, whether it is the power of our armies, the prosperity of our citizens, or the wisdom of our sages, but do not underestimate us. On the contrary, we may be stronger than we appear."
 CSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "The customs and language of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are not like those of the [Root.GetSpeciesName]. However, the inhabitants of [From.GetName] are full of virtue and learning, despite their foreign origins."
 CSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "In antiquity, the great sages taught all proper conduct and ritual, but in this diminished age of corruption and strife, much has been forgotten. We are glad that the [From.GetName] are, like us, humble followers of the sages' way."
 CSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and honor are things to be ashamed of. But the [From.GetName] is both well-off and well governed, and we consider you dear comrades."
 CSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Friends! Let us enjoy a warm cup of [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] tea and recite ancient poetry, before we attend to the business of the day."
 CSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] wishes to present you with a painting of the beautiful landscape of [From.GetHomeWorldName]. We hope that [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] will find it pleasing in its artistic skill."
 CSG_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "By three methods we may learn wisdom. First, by reflection, which is the noblest. Second, by imitation, which is the easiest. And, lastly, third by experience, which is the bitterest. All other options have failed, and our peoples now war against each other. This will be a bitter experience for us all."
 CSG_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "What stratagems do your commanders utilize? We are quite curious. We have studied the art of war for many years."
 CSG_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Our chief commander has recently composed a bit of poetry about his thoughts on this war between our two peoples. Perhaps you would like to read it?"
 CSG_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "Would you like to drink some [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] tea with us? Even if we are enemies, that does not mean we cannot enjoy some poetry, listen to music, and engage in pleasant conversation, before we must inevitably return to the battlefield."
 CSG_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "Oh! Representatives from the [From.GetName]! Ah, a pity you do not seem to want peace. I suspect, then, that you wish to listen to some pleasing music with us, and engage in a poetry duel - a battle of the wits! - before we both inevitably return to the battlefield?"
 # Vassal greetings
 CSG_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! It is the [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment] from [From.GetName]. You are like our sages, come here to teach us the way."
 CSG_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "In the days of old, sages walked [Root.GetHomeWorldName] taught our people right from wrong, taught them the proper rituals, taught them how to recite poetry, play music, and paint the world. Shall you do the same with us?"
 CSG_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "The gentlemen and gentlewomen of [From.GetName] are modern-day sages accomplished in the arts. Your poetry is astounding in meaning, your painting is excellent in aesthetic, your music is pleasing in its emotions. Our poets, painters, and musicians, though capable, seek to emulate yours."
 # Declaration of War
 CSG_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! The disgraceful behavior of the [From.GetName] can no longer be tolerated. You think us weak because we love poetry and music more than war? We shall prove you wrong on the battlefield most assuredly."

 MK_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "If we had no choice, we would rather betray the world than let the world betray us, and we would more than happily betray the [From.GetName]."
 MK_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Has [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] lost the Mandate of Heaven? Oh, what are we even saying. It is [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] who has the Mandate of Heaven - how could barbarians such as the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] ever have it?"
 MK_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are cowardly and inept. Their soldiers wield weapons, but know not how to use them."
 MK_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are crafty and immoral. They have no laws, and are little better than [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]. Their products are inferior and of little worth."
 MK_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "You are in the presence of [Root.GetName], the Middle Kingdom. Have you come to give us tribute? You should consider yourselves blessed that we even allow uncouth, ignorant, vile barbarian [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult] such as yourselves gaze upon the might and splendor of our culture."
 MK_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetName] are primitive and uncultured, barely more sentient than [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]. Their products, while of questionable quality, may be of interest to [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] traders."
 MK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We are the [Root.GetName], and we have the Mandate of Heaven. As heaven's filial sons and daughters, we will duly serve the wishes of heaven. Therefore, it would be prudent for the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to pay us their proper respects and give us proper tribute, for we are the center of the galaxy."
 MK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "In the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] language, we sometimes call our great nation the 'Middle Kingdom.' This is because as we are the divinely appointed rulers of the universe, we can logically conclude that we are therefore the center of it."
 MK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Our explorers say that the people of the [From.GetName] are said to be shrewd and friendly. They come from [From.GetHomeWorldName], a world neither paradise nor hell. Its soil is suitable for agriculture, and its air breathable and its skies strange of color. Would you say this assessment is correct?"
 MK_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "To see the barbarian nation of [From.GetName], ruled by the [From.GetSpeciesNameAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult], stronger and more prosperous than us is the greatest humiliation. Has heaven forsaken us?"
 MK_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "The people of [From.GetName] are mighty but arrogant. Their armies are vast and powerful, and their traders sly and cunning. They are surely a peoples we should be wary of."
 MK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "A word of advice to our cherished friends in the [From.GetName]: In peaceful times we may esteem moral conduct, but when there is trouble it is achievement and ability that is rewarded. It is good that [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] show both qualities of moral conduct as well as achievement and ability."
 MK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetName] has proven itself almost like a sibling. Though we are the Middle Kingdom, it is certain that heaven regards you as a close second in terms of glory and greatness."
 MK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "If we were to ever lose the Mandate of Heaven, we will hope that it is the [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment] [From.GetName] who will pick it up and continue where we left off!"
 MK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are brave and strong. Even if their enemies outnumber them, their soldiers will always emerge victorious with their brilliant stratagems and superior training."
 MK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are clever and intelligent. Their laws are fair and just, and their people humble and kind. They are industrious, and so their products are of superior quality. They appear like beautiful [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment], and for this all in the galaxy love them."
 MK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_06:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends, honoured by all, we pay respect to you and are pleased to hear that [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] is in good health. Let us talk of how we can bolster trade and commerce among our two peoples."

 MK_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! The people of [From.GetName] are devious, vulgar, and of inferior morals. They ruin others, and constantly bring trouble to all civilized. Therefore, let it be known that in this year that [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] shall wage war against the [From.GetName] to restore order and balance to the galaxy."

 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_04:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] honor those who are scholars and thinkers. Those who have written the most eloquent treatises on natural philosophy or have spent years exploring the stars are their leaders."
 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_05:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are ruled by harsh leaders. Their laws are strict. If the one who enforces the law is not strict enough, then he too is disciplined. Even the [From.GetRulerTitle] is subject to these strict laws."
 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_06:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] have lenient laws, and the people are free to criticize their leaders. If there are unexpected calamities and disasters, the [From.GetRulerTitle] is unceremoniously rejected and replaced. The one who has been dismissed quietly accepts his demotion, and is not angry."
 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_07:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are unfriendly and suspicious of others. They hide in their houses and do not speak if they see foreigners."
 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_08:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are friendly and welcoming. When a stranger comes by a village, the villagers compete with each other, hoping the stranger will accept their hospitality and stay with them for the night."

 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Ha! Such boors, you [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]. You would not recognize beauty if you saw it, inner or outer beauty."
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "You have offended us many times. Know that we are the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] spirits who dwell in the heavenly abode of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. We are as vengeful and wrathful and petty as we are loving and silly and happy-go-lucky!"
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "Sometimes we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have an unfortunate tendency to seduce others by accident, but we would never do that to a [From.GetSpeciesName], oh no. You are by far too ugly and repulsive, both in appearance and personality."
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "Yes, it is true, we are fairy-spirits of a sort, who have ascended our previously lesser natures. It's clear that you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are the opposite - your true natures are ruined as you become hungry ghosts and wanton demons."
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "You foul [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]! You do not deserve to see our dainty, pretty faces or hear our sweet, dulcet voices, so lowly and unworthy of character you are."
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_07:0 "You beg for our attention. What vulgar fellows! We are not prostitutes whose pleasant company can be bought, and we only cavort with the intelligent and the cultured."
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_08:0 "Haha! Look at these [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]. How sad! How pathetic! Your illness of the spirit is clearly deserved."
 BS_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Us? What about us? Yes, we are the great fairies who come from the majestic realm of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. Could it be that you are lacking in virtue and wisdom? Perhaps. But if you do not taunt us, why should we worry about you?"
 BS_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "We were once like you in our distant past - weak, ignorant beings, subject to the miseries of existence. But we have since ascended to become the heavenly spirits that we are. Perhaps one day, you'll achieve the same!"
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Don't be too serious, silly! Let us relax and get to know each other better!"
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "You may've heard rumors that we're actually mischievous fairies of sort who come to ruin the peoples of other nations. The second part is false, but the first is true, we admit. But we're not dangerous, we promise!"
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Though our scholars are still trying to figure out how, at some point in our distant past, we became the fairy-spirits that we are today. Yes, this is all true - but do not fear us! We are good to the kind and just, and fearsome to the rowdy and boorish."
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "Oh my! You thought that was a [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] tail that touched you by accident? I assure you not, we have no such intentions. Yet."
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "We may have a dainty appearance and dulcet voices, but worry not, we can prove our mettle in both the martial arts and the literary arts."
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "Some say we possess unearthly beauty, others say our voices can calm even the saddest or angriest of souls. Who is to say they are wrong or right? All we know are we are the ever-mirthful fairies who call [Root.GetHomeWorldName] our home."
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "A chance meeting between the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName] - is friendship or love fated between our two peoples?"
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_08:0 "Why are you so shy? Relax, come join us!"
 BS_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Oh! We are mere fairies who live in our humble land of [Root.GetHomeWorldName], what quarrel would we ever have with the great [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]? We wish you nothing but peace and happiness."
 BS_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Look at us, compared to you! Would us humble, pitiful spirits who dwell in the fairly-land of [Root.GetHomeWorldName] dare insult such powerful masters of fate such as the [From.GetName]? Certainly not."
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are but humble fairies, who love to dance and sing and engage in pleasant conversation. We have learned our ways from the heavens, and everyone says we are so enchanting. Friends, would you like to join us in some dance and song?"
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Oh, you [From.GetSpeciesNameAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment] are so silly. You appear so serious all the time, and we really worry about the [From.GetName] all the time. Come with us, enjoy some drinks, and then let us get to business."
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "It's true that some [Root.GetSpeciesNameAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment] have recently accidentally seduced and sucked out the life forces of some unwitting [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural].... We swear it wasn't intentional, and we have reprimanded the offenders. Now, why don't we discuss some more pleasant matters?"
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "They say it is not good to live in interesting times. Let our two peoples live happily together, forever, in uninteresting and peaceful times - us, the lovely, ever-singing [Root.GetSpeciesNameAdj] fairy-spirits, and you, our beloved, brilliant, gifted [From.GetSpeciesNameAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment]."
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "We've thought about it, and we'd like to ask. Are you sure that you[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] aren't a race of fairy-spirits like ourselves? After all, you possess an unearthly beauty and talent in the arts, and [From.GetHomeWorldName] seems as much a paradise fairy-land as [Root.GetHomeWorldName]."
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_06:0 "Maybe we should encourage interspecies marriages between our two races. What do you say? Other species in the galaxy wage wars just to be able to marry a [Root.GetSpeciesNameAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesNameCompliment], and here we are offering you the opportunity - perhaps it is you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] who have seduced us!"
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_07:0 "We are [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] spirits who dwell in the heavenly abode of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. Don't fear us! We do not intend any harm. We have seen into your true natures, and despite whatever flaws you may have, we consider you to be honest, intelligent, great [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment] of the highest order!"
 BS_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "All's fair in love and war, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. By the way, we still think you need to relax and take it easy. There's no way you're going to win this war if you're so serious and narrow-minded."
 BS_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Such oafs you are! Even your ships and weapons lack the grace and eloquence of ours."
 BS_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Bewitched by our appearance? You cannot help it, we know. Maybe we don't even need to conquer you with violence, we could just do it by seducing you all."
 BS_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "Do not be fooled by our dainty appearance and dulcet voices. We are great and powerful spirits after all!"
 BS_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "How crude and ignorant. You pride yourselves as intelligent and strong. Well then, show us! If you don't relax every now and then, you will only exhaust yourselves and prove unable to fight back. Moderation is key to winning wars."
 # Vassal greetings
 BS_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Oh! Our delightful lords have come to visit us.Come relax with us in the paradise that is [Root.GetHomeWorldName] first before we get to more serious matters."
 BS_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "You are our lords and masters aren't you? Then why are you so shy? We're here for you."
 # Declaration of War
 BS_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Now war is serious business indeed, and we do not take this decision likely. But you coarse, rude fellows need to be taught a lesson!"
 BS_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! You've offended the great spirits of [Root.GetName]! We ask only a little respect, and all you do is insult us at every turn."
 BS_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are such pitiful beggars and ruffians who need to learn a thing or two about life. As the heavenly spirits who come from [Root.GetHomeWorldName], we'll show you a thing or two."
